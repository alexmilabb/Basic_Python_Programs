print(max(4, 6))  # --> gives maximum number out of 2 or more integers
print(min(4, 6))  # --> gives minimum number out of 2 or more integers

print(round(3.2))  # --> round the number closest to the lower or higher value depending on the actual number

print(ceil(3.3))  # --> always gives the higher number that hits the ceiling

print(sqrt(36))  # --> gives back the square root of a number
